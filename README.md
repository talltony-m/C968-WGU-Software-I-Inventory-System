C968 WGU Software I A basic Inventory System with products and associated parts
This is my final submission of a C# Windows Forms software project for school. I used Visual Studio 2019 as the IDE.
The inventory system has parts that make up products. Both parts and products can be added, deleted, and modified.
Part variables included minimum, maximum, inventory level, price, and either Inhouse with a Machine ID or Outsourced with a Comapny Name.
Products are made up from parts and the product can not be deleted unless all the associated parts are deleted first. Minimum Inventory, Maximum Invetory & Price are other variables. This is the final commit. I passed the course.
